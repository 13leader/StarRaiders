Hi.

If you're reading this, it's probably because you already know what's going on and want to pitch in; if not, I refer you to:

Here's the quick-and-dirty version of what you need to know:

	If there's a non-ATASCII character, flag the file or make a note of it.
	If you don't know what ATASCII is, don't offer to help - this is not the time nor the place to teach you.

	Lines are to be in the format "AAAA BB CC DD	ETC".
	Note there is a tab between the address and operands ("AAAA BB CC DD") and the actual line of code ("ETC").
	If any part is missing or not applicable, pad its absence with spaces.

	Based on the printouts I've seen so far, there are 8 spaces per tab.
	If you can tell where tabs belong based on how the text aligns, great; if you can't, don't guess.

	There is no line wrapping.
	Whether you're CR, LF, or CRLF, keep it consistent.

	Ignore the header.
	Yes, each page starts with "STAR RAIDERS, VERSION 25.1  STARDATE 26-JUL-79", but we don't need it in each and every file.

	Each physical page has a corresponding text file.
	The only exception to this is 000.txt (what you're reading right now, dummy!).

	Be faithful to the original.
	This project isn't about revisionism or improving existing code - it's about preserving existing code, warts and all.
	If it's was printed by the printer, it belongs in the text file.
	If you do come across any marks that a printer couldn't've made, flag the file and move on.

	Don't fix typos, don't change upper/lower case, don't collapse spaces, and don't sign your work (I consider that vandalism).

	Go through the list of typed-in pages.
	If there's a number missing from the series, upload a text file and start it; if there's a blank file and it's not your work, don't touch it.
	Remember: if say you're going to do it, do it!

	GitHub's job is to handle the "who did what when" stuff.
	When the project's complete, it'll do your contribution/bragging for you.
	:-)

	Scrutinize twice, type once.
	Getting it right the first time spares everyone the headache of having to type things over twice.
	The more typos you make, the less likely your services will be wanted.

That pretty much covers everything.  You're trusted from the get-go to do the right thing. That privilege lasts as long as you are responsibile.

Welcome, pitch in, have fun, type in, and LIST "C: often!
