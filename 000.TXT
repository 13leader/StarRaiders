Hi.

If you're reading this, it's probably because you already know what's going on and want to pitch in; if not, I refer you to:

Here's the quick-and-dirty version of what you need to know:

	The priority is to get the printout into text files.
	Once this project is completed, we'll clean up any typographical issues (read on).

	If there's a non-ATASCII character in the print version (like "`", "~", "{" or "}"), flag the file or make a note of it.  
	If you don't know what ATASCII is, don't offer to help - this is not the time nor the place to teach you.

	Be faithful to the original.
	This project isn't about revisionism or improving existing code - it's about preserving existing code, warts and all.
	If it was printed by the printer, it belongs in the text file.
	If you do come across any marks that a printer couldn't've made, flag the file and move on.

	The prinout appears to be in the format "   ADDR Op Ar Gs	Label	Code", but should be entered as it appears in print.
	Note there is a tab between the address and operands ("AAAA BB CC DD"), the line label ("LABEL"), and the code ("ETC").
	If the address and/or operands are missing, pad its absence with spaces.  
	If the label is missing, omit it (Yes, two tabs in a row).

		There's a lot of confusion on this point because the format in the listing itself is inconsistent.  
		If there's any doubt, copy the printout exactly.  

	Based on the printouts I've seen so far, there are 8 spaces per tab.  
	If you can tell where tabs belong based on how the text aligns, great; if you can't, made dang sure you use the right number of spaces.

	There is no line wrapping.
	Whether you're CR, LF, or CRLF, keep it consistent.

	Ignore the header.
	Yes, each page starts with "STAR RAIDERS.	VERSION 25.1	STARDATE-26-JUL-79", but we don't need it in each and every file.

	Each physical page has a corresponding text file.
	The only exception to this is 000.txt (what you're reading right now, dummy!).

	Don't fix typos, don't change upper/lower case, don't collapse spaces.

	Go through the list of typed-in pages.
	If there's a number missing from the series, upload a text file and start it; if there's a blank file and it's not your work, don't touch it.
	Remember: if say you're going to do it, do it!

	Don't vandalize.
	You don't need to sign your work.  
	GitHub's job is to handle the "who did what when" stuff.  
	When the project's complete, it'll do your contribution/bragging for you.  

	Scrutinize twice, type once.
	Getting it right the first time spares everyone the headache of having to type things over twice.
	The more typos you make, the less likely your services will be wanted.

That pretty much covers everything you need to know.  

Down the road we'll correct tabs, spaces, tpyos, and pretty-print it all.  
But, as I said, the priority is to go from ink-on-paper to code-in-files.  

You're trusted from the get-go to do the right thing.  
That privilege lasts as long as you are responsibile.  

Welcome, pitch in, have fun, type in, and LIST "C: often!
